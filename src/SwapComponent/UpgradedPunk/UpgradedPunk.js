            The new ERC-721 Punk will be the{" "}

              exact Punk that you originally minted

            to you for sticking around with us through this transition.

          <p>
            Our new contract is keeping the Punks{" "}

            <span className="bold-txt-1">mint completes.</span>
            This means that you won't be able to transfer your Punks out of your
            wallet until the mint is over. We are doing this to counter any
            nefarious activities that occur during Project mints, such as floor
            crashing bots. As such, we{" "}
            <span className="bold-txt-1">highly recommend</span> transferring
            all of your OG Pioneer Crypt3d Punk NFT's into{" "}
            <span className="bold-txt-1">one wallet </span> before doing the
            swap, so they all land in the same, safe place, together, with their
            new <span className="bold-txt-1">free friends</span> .
          </p>

            You will need to approve this transaction in your Web3 wallet.
